Test the application using Swagger UI 
- http://localhost:8084/swagger-ui.html

>>>

CircuitBreaker - Circuit Breaker has been applied to addBook API. 
To test if it's working, we will stop the Book Management service.
First, observe the health of the application by hitting the URL
http://localhost:8084/actuator/health 

>>>


Once it crosses the threshold, which in this case is 5, it will trip the circuit. And,
each call after that will directly go to the fallback method without making an attempt
to hit Book Management service. (You can verify this by going to logs and observe the
logger statement. Now, we can observe the /health endpoint showing CircuitBreaker state
as "OPEN".
